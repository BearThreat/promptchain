%FIRST%,

I have SHOCKING news to report from the University of Memphis..


At a Turning Point USA chapter event, Black Lives Matter protestors CHASED DOWN Turning Point USA students and event attendees ... tried to BLOCK CARS from leaving ... and had to be HELD BACK by campus police to prevent PHYSICAL ATTACKS.

%FIRST%, I can take on the Left's LIES, SMEARS, and vicious ATTACKS -- in fact, I'm used to it. But when Leftists go after our Turning Point USA students, staff, and attendees, I will NEVER stay silent.

Will you help Turning Point USA demand accountability from the University of Memphis and stand strong with our brave campus chapter?

<< Button: Stand with Turning Point USA students >>

Ahead of our Turning Point USA chapter's event with Kyle Rittenhouse, the University of Memphis did EVERYTHING in its power to SHUT IT DOWN -- and put attendees IN HARM'S WAY as a result!

In the days and hours before the Turning Point USA chapter event:

		The Turning Point USA chapter president was DOXXED with his name and personal address published online by vicious Leftists,
		The university SLASHED seating for the event to SUPPRESS attendance and FORCED a last-minute ticketing change,
		Administrators reportedly LEAKED information about the new, university-managed ticketing to protestor groups so they could SABOTAGE the event, and
		The University of Memphis REFUSED to remove disruptive protestors, reportedly telling our Turning Point USA students that it would be the students' "responsibility to de-escalate" screaming Leftists!

Despite the UNPRECEDENTED obstacles, our Turning Point USA students pressed forward with an event that was responsibly managed and advanced free speech.

But, %FIRST%, make no mistake: I am FULLY COMMITTED to demanding accountability from the University of Memphis -- and I'd bet that YOU are too.

If I can count on YOUR support, please make your most generous gift of <<gift array>> to help us stand up for our brave Turning Point USA students.

<< Button: Stand with Turning Point USA students >>

The "Woke" Left is TERRIFIED of Turning Point USA's success in inspiring MILLIONS of kids to turn away from Leftism and love America again.

The Left can't compete with us on the battlefield of ideas, so they try to SILENCE us through MOB RULE -- and that's why they're resorting to these DESPERATE and VIOLENT tactics.

By standing strong with our Turning Point USA students, we can show Leftists that when they try to SILENCE our brave and patriotic Turning Point USA students, they only AMPLIFY our voices.

Thank you for your support of Turning Point USA and our 750,000+ student activists as we FIGHT BACK against the "Woke" takeover of higher education and American culture.

Together, we'll WIN the American Culture War and inspire this generation to LOVE AMERICA once again.

The "Woke" Left wants you to believe that they have PERMANENT CONTROL of America's young people. 

But thanks to YOUR support of Turning Point USA, there is a MASSIVE generational change underway, with young people becoming MORE CONSERVATIVE.

As I've shared with you, recent data has shown that:

	High school senior boys are the MOST CONSERVATIVE they have been in 50+ 		YEARS.

	From 2017 to 2022, 10 MILLION young people turned away from Leftism and 			learned to LOVE AMERICA again. 

	And I truly know that, with your continued support, we are just getting started!

  

%FIRST%, I'm thrilled that Turning Point USA's VOTE AND LIVE effort has already registered THOUSANDS of new student voters, who LOVE our country and believe in AMERICAN GREATNESS.

With VOTE AND LIVE, Turning Point USA is reaching MILLIONS of young people through:

		on-the-ground VOTER REGISTRATION efforts, as TPUSA field reps and chapters help high school and college students get registered to vote in their state before the next election,
		student-led VOTE AND LIVE activism at schools across America, thanks to attention-getting and educational VOTE AND LIVE activism kits that Turning Point USA is able to provide to our 1,500+ student chapters, and
		the restoration of PASSION and FAITH in voting among Generation Z (or, as we call this generation, "Gen Z Free"!), as we inspire young people to pick up the mantle handed down to us by our Founding Fathers -- and understand that saving or country still starts with getting registered and voting!

With your support, Turning Point USA will EDUCATE Gen Z about our nation's founding principles and Constitution ... REGISTER these America-loving young people to vote ... and INSPIRE the next generation to stand up for American Greatness -- starting by casting a vote.

We are TAKING BACK America's future from the radical Left, as we inspire MILLIONS of young people to LOVE AMERICA again -- and get registered to VOTE!

### line 1 framework
[[piece_1_structure_example_piece]]



Please create a topic-agnostic framework that outlines the flow and key elements of the above persuasive piece, focusing on how it purposefully guides the reader's attention. The framework should be generalized and adaptable to various topics. For each element, include the exact number of sentences used.

Use the following element format: 
Total word count: (entire piece word count (please underestimate by 20%))
[Element 1 description] (element 1 sentence count, element 1 word count)
[Element 2 description] (element 2 sentence count, element 2 word count)
ect...

Use vague language wherever possible:
law, order, and the police -> topic subject
a free book -> something valuable
$25 -> small contribution
Speech First -> organization

Example:
[Personalized greeting, emphasizing importance of topic subject] (x sen, y words)
[Initial call to action - gain some value in exchange for small contribution to support organization] (x2 sen, y2 words)
ect...

Avoid personal anecdotes and statistics as they don't abstract to new topics well (instead use your judgement and replace with something else)
Please create an element format, the purposeful elements of a persuasive piece, from introduction to conclusion. Go through each line, clearly tracing the attention and imaging the emotions of the reader. We're fundamentally abstracting out the order of techniques that intentionally direct the reader's perspective. ONLY write the element format. Don't discuss ANYTHING, just start with the first line
