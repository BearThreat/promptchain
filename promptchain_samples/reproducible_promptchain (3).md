Will you help save a preborn babys life today?

 

One abortion occurs every minute in America. More than 1,600 abortions occur every day.

 

But when a mother facing an unplanned pregnancy receives a free ultrasound session from PreBorn! -- when she sees her babys tiny hands and feet and hears her babys heartbeat -- by Gods grace, everything changes.

 

When she sees her baby on an ultrasound, she will choose life (instead of abortion) 80% of the time. Without an ultrasound, one out of every three preborn babies will tragically perish.

 

%FIRST%, will you make a gift of $28 today so that PreBorn! can provide ONE MORE free ultrasound session to a young mom at a crossroads?

While the abortion debate rages in state legislatures and courtrooms, PreBorn! has taken a different approach: leading the nation in empowering women facing unplanned pregnancies by offering compassionate, Christ-centered care.

 

Please let me tell you the story of just one young woman that PreBorn! has reached.

 

Lauren was terrified when she discovered her unplanned pregnancy.

 

Facing extreme pressure from her boyfriend, she sought an abortion in her home state of Ohio  but she was turned away due to the states new legislation.

 

Lauren's boyfriend put her on a plane to Washington, D.C. to send her to the largest abortion clinic in the region.

 

But on her way to the abortion clinic, Lauren got lost  and when she walked into the doors of the PreBorn! Network Clinic, she was embraced with compassion and love like she had never known.

 

Lauren saw her preborn baby thanks to a free ultrasound and heard the steady whoosh of her little ones beating heart. Lauren heard the Gospel, opened her heart to Jesus abundant grace and love  and she chose life!

 

%FIRST%, every day we hear more stories like this.

 

We praise God for His intervention on behalf of these women and their children. To Him alone be the Glory!

 

To help more women see their preborn babies on an ultrasound and choose life, please support PreBorn! with your gift of $28 or more today.

Is it too late to save my baby? pleaded Adreiona when she called a PreBorn! Pregnancy Clinic late one night.

 

Panicking, she continued, I took the abortion pill. Everyone is telling me that since Im in college, I cant manage a baby. 

 

Thankfully, Adreionas story has a happy ending, because she reached out to PreBorn! within the first 72 hours, received an abortion reversal pill, and her babys life was saved! 

 

By offering services to expectant mothers like Adreiona at no cost, PreBorn! reaches women considering abortion and equips Pregnancy Clinics to save lives. Will you help save more babies and souls with your gift of $35, $50, $100, or more today?

Support life-affirming care!

My name is Dan Steiner, and Im the founder and president of PreBorn! You may have heard of our work from some of your favorite media personalities like Ben Shapiro, Glenn Beck, Dan Bongino, Mark Levin, and others. 

 

I founded PreBorn! because I was heartbroken by the knowledge that countless women facing unplanned pregnancies often make rushed decisions before having time to investigate their emotions and understand all of their options.  

 

A national study found that more than 60% of women who had abortions felt pressured to abort.  

 

Like Adreiona, another young mother named Abby felt this pressure. Fortunately, she connected with a PreBorn! Pregnancy Clinic before it was too late.  

 

Abby arrived at the Clinic with her boyfriend, Michael, to learn more about abortion and have an ultrasound. During this scan, the nurse showed the expectant parents the lively image of their 8-week-old baby with its heart beating.  

 

This experience had a profound effect on Abby and Michael, who were amazed by how real it was to see and hear their baby.  

 

That day, another life was saved!  

 

To help more women receive ultrasounds and have the chance to hear their babys heartbeat  and see that this life is a baby, not just a mass of cells  please help with your immediate gift today.

 

At PreBorn!, we are blessed to be able to help women not only to choose life for their babies, but also to choose eternal life for themselves. 

 

We praise God that we have seen over 77,000 commitments to Christ by mothers- and fathers-to-be as we minister to them in their moments of crisis. 

 

We are blessed to proclaim the Gospel of Jesus every day to women like Lorelle, who confessed to her PreBorn! advocate that she felt like she had let God down, and he couldnt possibly accept her. 

 

Her advocate reminded her of Romans 8:1, which says, There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus -- that though she had sinned, there is grace and forgiveness waiting for us when we repent of our sins and trust in Christ for our salvation. 

 

Lorelle was thankful for this clear and compassionate proclamation of the Gospel from her Client Advocate, saying, I felt so comfortable to just cry and open up. At her ultrasound appointment a few days later, Lorelle chose life for her baby. Praise the Lord! 

 

Stories like this are happening every day as PreBorn! interacts with young women in need. 

 

You can help us continue this life-saving, Gospel-proclaiming work with your generous gift today.

 

Abortion is the defining issue of our generation, and while pro-abortion activists present abortion as a easy fix to a complicated situation, you and I know that abortion is a traumatic experience that kills a child and leaves a mother scarred. 

 

Every year, more than 800,000 babies are slaughtered at the hands of abortionists. 

 

But by connecting with life-affirming PreBorn! Pregnancy Clinics, women like Adreiona, Abby, and Lorelle can find resources to support them as they make life-saving decisions for their babies and eternity-shaping decisions for themselves.  

 

As we work to give women access to life-affirming care and advance the gospel and Jesus Christ, we rely on the generous financial partnership of friends just like you.

 

Please help make the miracle of motherhood a reality for women considering abortion with your gift of $35 or more.

Abortion is the greatest humanitarian crisis of our generation.

All that PreBorn! does is motivated by a desire to see the Gospel of Jesus Christ transform the lives of mothers and their children.

 

Our PreBorn! Network Clinics even receive an evangelism training program to equip them with the tools required to move beyond the fears and misconceptions of sharing the Gospel.

 

We put an enormous emphasis on prayer, which, I believe, is the reason we lead the nation in the number of clinic visitors who come to know Jesus Christ as their Savior.

 

Prayer is powerful. Jesus hears us.

[[client_codex]]


The essence of a person's writing style is reflected in the consistent expression of their values through their personality. Unlike the goal, which is the desired end state, style is about how ideas are framed and conveyed. A writer's style can be identified through the characteristic word choice in repeated sentiment and recurring themes. 

Use 5 underscores to represent(and ignore) irrelevant content. Note that we want to ONLY imitate style. 
the "Woke" Left -> _____ 
faith into action -> _____ 

Example Style Abstraction Phrases: 
partnering in _____ mission 
_____ toxic agenda 
patriotic, _____ like you 
ect...

### line 1 framework
[[piece_1_structure_example_piece]]



Please create a topic-agnostic framework that outlines the flow and key elements of the above persuasive piece, focusing on how it purposefully guides the reader's attention. The framework should be generalized and adaptable to various topics. For each element, include the exact number of sentences used.

Use the following element format: 
Total word count: (entire piece word count (please underestimate by 20%))
[Element 1 description] (element 1 sentence count, element 1 word count)
[Element 2 description] (element 2 sentence count, element 2 word count)
ect...

Use vague language wherever possible:
law, order, and the police -> topic subject
a free book -> something valuable
$25 -> small contribution
Speech First -> organization

Example:
[Personalized greeting, emphasizing importance of topic subject] (x sen, y words)
[Initial call to action - gain some value in exchange for small contribution to support organization] (x2 sen, y2 words)
ect...

Avoid personal anecdotes and statistics as they don't abstract to new topics well (instead use your judgement and replace with something else)
Please create an element format, the purposeful elements of a persuasive piece, from introduction to conclusion. Go through each line, clearly tracing the attention and imaging the emotions of the reader. We're fundamentally abstracting out the order of techniques that intentionally direct the reader's perspective. ONLY write the element format. Don't discuss ANYTHING, just start with the first line
