## Variables
- client_name: PreBorn!
- client_value_prop: PreBorn! is a dedicated non-profit, pro-life organization that supports life-affirming Pregnancy Clinics in their mission to reach women considering abortion, particularly in areas with high abortion rates.
- client_codex: When I came to Christ, would get up every morning between 4.30 and 6.30 to pray. In that time with the Lord, he shared with me his broken heart over every little baby that they're violently ripped away and robbed of their future and of his plans for them, their kindergarten, their graduation, their prom, their marriage, their children and grandchildren done. And that breaks God's heart because he lives in eternity. He sees all of that. 
    Where's the person that wants to alleviate his pain? And I said, Lord, what can I do about that? So early on, I would go down to a local abortion clinic, encountering people that are going in, they're trying to persuade them not to do that. Here comes this couple, and as they were approaching, I can see that these are different. They look like the same distressed people that are coming in. They're going into the abortion claim, but they agreed with us entirely. 
    Turns out, this is the pastor's daughter and her boyfriend from their church. When they came out, they were different people. And it's just this hopelessness of how can we stop this killing. And it wasn't anything we could do. 
    This issue is the defining issue of our generation. There's never been a time from Adam until today where there's been any hidden persecuted people group exterminated at the rate of nearly a million, 800,000 every week globally. And so at that time, I was supporting a number of different pregnancy clinics and the local center missing their executive director. So there was a letter that came for the executive director's position. 
    And I thought, I wonder if I should apply to that. But I've already done something and I did it in my own strength. So I thought, I'm not going to do that again. So, you know, if you want me to apply for this position, come and get me. 
    Valerie and I are attending this little Baptist church. And sitting in front of me was a guy that was a friend of mine. After the service, he turned around and says, here. And he hands me his prayer request, but they weren't on a card. 
    They were scribbled on the back of an envelope. So I said, oh, that's a nice mark. But I've got my prayer request here. He says, open the envelope. 
    So I turned the envelope over, and it's the same envelope that I had received back home. He was on their mail list, too. He goes, take the job. We took the job at this pregnancy clinic, and they were flat broke. 
    I said, God, what have you done to me? These guys are in trouble and I'm in bigger trouble because they hired me and I have absolutely no idea what to do. But I do know this. If I honor Jesus Christ, he'll honor what we do. The very first thing we did, we get 210 volunteer prayer warriors to pray for the ministry. 
    Our goal was in everything we did to honor Jesus Christ, to make him practically, and not just rhetorically, the chief executive officer of that pregnancy clinic. So we made the gospel the centerpiece of that ministry. And because we did that, what we began to see was supernatural results. Funding went up, volunteers went up. 
    We started expanding. We went from a two-center operation to 14 centers, 14,000 pregnancy tests a year. Thousands of people coming to Christ every year. If this works in Indiana, I wonder if it would work anywhere else. 
    The board wasn't particularly interested in that vision, and so that caused a parting of ways for us. So we decided that what we would do is we would go and we would serve these pregnancy clinics. Don't ask anything for it and believe that the Lord would supply our needs. We didn't have an office, we didn't have any equipment, you know, we didn't have any funding, no guarantees, except one. 
    And it says, I will be with you, I will never fail you, nor forsake you. And so we took the step, moved forward with mission pre-born at that time in 2006. That was the genesis of it. It was a wonderful time of seeing the provision of God as an affirmation that we were doing the right thing. 
    We brought a confluence of a couple of different things. We would bring good business practice, but they won't work without the power source. The power source is Romans 116, the Gospel of Jesus Christ. And so we went forth and did that with the biggest pregnancy clinics in America, helping them make the gospel of Jesus Christ the center of their ministries so that the power of God to come into their ministries. 
    And it did. Pre-Borne started gaining momentum. We had a guy that came up to us and he said, you know, if any of the pregnancy centers need ultrasound equipment, I'd like to give them. And so we would just give these brand new ultrasound machines away. 
    That, again, was putting a principle into place that is in the word of God given, it'll be given to you. What we found out was that then we could ask people across the nation for ultrasound equipment, and they would be glad to supply it. And so a pre-born supplies dozens and dozens of ultrasound machines every year for free two pregnancy clinics. But underneath all of that, our heart, which is you're going to have to listen to and participate in the invitation, which is our gospel program, which really works. 
    And if they will use this program, they'll see 340% more women come to Christ than the previous year. So we have been unwavering as best as our humanity can in trying to apply the Word of God and the principles of God and to honor God. It's a promise that if you will honor him, he will honor you. The greatest honor we have is to do more for Jesus Christ in our lives, to further the gospel more in our lives. 
    And so Preborn is at the place now from humble beginnings where Valerie K. Steiner took a leap of faith and said, yeah, I think, I think you can do this is what she said to me, when we had nothing to the point where we're the largest pro-life organization, one of the London entire planet. Preborn has seen since those humble beginnings, over 200,000 babies saved, over 59,000 people come to Christ. And so we have to have the gospel as part and parcel and really the heartbeat of what preborn is. 
    The challenge of American Christianity is that we repeat in our minds and then with our lips these fondly held sets of values that we really don't practice in our life. Yeah, I'm against abortion, but what are you doing to show that? Faithful that works after all is of none effect. And so there's a number of things you can do, volunteering for your local center you can give, you can pray, you can volunteer your skills at pre-born and other ministries to alleviate God's pain over this issue. So I just encourage everyone to step forward and do it with the camera.

Please let me tell you the story of just one young woman that PreBorn! has reached.

 

Lauren was terrified when she discovered her unplanned pregnancy.

 

Facing extreme pressure from her boyfriend, she sought an abortion in her home state of Ohio  but she was turned away due to the states new legislation.

 

Lauren's boyfriend put her on a plane to Washington, D.C. to send her to the largest abortion clinic in the region.

 

But on her way to the abortion clinic, Lauren got lost  and when she walked into the doors of the PreBorn! Network Clinic, she was embraced with compassion and love like she had never known.

 

Lauren saw her preborn baby thanks to a free ultrasound and heard the steady whoosh of her little ones beating heart. Lauren heard the Gospel, opened her heart to Jesus abundant grace and love  and she chose life!

[[client_codex]]


The essence of a person's writing style is reflected in the consistent expression of their values through their personality. Unlike the goal, which is the desired end state, style is about how ideas are framed and conveyed. A writer's style can be identified through the characteristic word choice in repeated sentiment and recurring themes. 

Use 5 underscores to represent(and ignore) irrelevant content. Note that we want to ONLY imitate style. 
the "Woke" Left -> _____ 
faith into action -> _____ 

Example Style Abstraction Phrases: 
partnering in _____ mission 
_____ toxic agenda 
patriotic, _____ like you

Dream a compelling character narrative that emphasizes each and EVERY one of the above character traits and values in as many words as necessary(length is not an issue). The CHALLENGE is to avoid EXPLICITLY describing personality traits. Reveal the character's personality through their life's actions and choices, EXCLUSIVELY through narrative. Write the character narrative in the above writing style, using dynamic sentence structure, direct, engaging, active voice, clear expression, facebook language, pleasing organization and structure, clarity, efficiency, and simplicity -> directly imaging the feel of the narrative.

### line 1 framework
[[piece_1_structure_example_piece]]



Please create a topic-agnostic framework that outlines the flow and key elements of the above persuasive piece, focusing on how it purposefully guides the reader's attention. The framework should be generalized and adaptable to various topics. For each element, include the exact number of sentences used.

Use the following element format: 
Total word count: (entire piece word count (please underestimate by 20%))
[Element 1 description] (element 1 sentence count, element 1 word count)
[Element 2 description] (element 2 sentence count, element 2 word count)
ect...

Use vague language wherever possible:
law, order, and the police -> topic subject
a free book -> something valuable
$25 -> small contribution
Speech First -> organization

Example:
[Personalized greeting, emphasizing importance of topic subject] (x sen, y words)
[Initial call to action - gain some value in exchange for small contribution to support organization] (x2 sen, y2 words)
ect...

Avoid personal anecdotes and statistics as they don't abstract to new topics well (instead use your judgement and replace with something else)
Please create an element format, the purposeful elements of a persuasive piece, from introduction to conclusion. Go through each line, clearly tracing the attention and imaging the emotions of the reader. We're fundamentally abstracting out the order of techniques that intentionally direct the reader's perspective. ONLY write the element format. Don't discuss ANYTHING, just start with the first line
