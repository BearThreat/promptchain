%FNAME%,
When colleges and universities fund Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) departments, they are enabling the actions of woke thought police like Tirien Steinbach, an Associate Dean of DEI at Stanford.
Just days ago, during an event at Stanford Law School hosted by the Federalist Society, Fifth Circuit Appellate Judge Stuart Kyle Duncan was shouted down and accosted by leftist disrupters who oppose free speech. Administrators stood idly by while the students violated university speech policies.  Finally, when Associate Dean of DEI Tirien Steinbach took the podium, she did so not to scold the student disruptors but to scold Judge Duncan for harming students by his mere presence on campus as a conservative speaker. 
Judge Duncan later recalled the incident as bizarre therapy sessions from hell in an interview with the Washington Free Beacon.
This disruption went much further than what could ever be deemed civilized protest, and this once once-esteemed institution has demonstrated that its administrators not only allow but actively support disruption of speech events.
So far, we have not seen any action taken against Steinbach by the university. Stanford merely issued a cut-and-paste apology letter to Duncan.  If the apology is serious, consequences must follow. 
Weve started a petition to Stanford University, demanding Tirien be REMOVED from office for apparently aiding and abetting a flagrant violation of university policy.
[ Sign our Petition NOW ]
Here are a few of the things Steinbach said to Judge Duncan during her prepared scolding of Judge Duncan, according to the Washington Free Beacons reporting:
Your opinions from the bench land as absolute disenfranchisement [of the students]  and they are tearing the fabric of this community.
Do you have something so incredibly important to saythat it is worth the division of these people?
Steinbach was joined by protestors who screamed, shouted, and caused pandemonium anytime Duncan would speakscreeching things like scumbag and youre a liar.
%FNAME%, there is something seriously wrong at Stanford Law.
While Stanford claims to stand for free expression, incidents like these will continue to occur until Stanford hands down decisive consequences.  
For years now the university has enacted speech codes, canceled speakers, discriminated against conservative organizations, solicited anonymous reports on students for their speech, and used harassment policies to target student speech that is considered offensive. 
Steinbach is the sad reality of what these DEI programs produceunregulated and unaccountable administrators acting unilaterally as professional Leftist activists.
This is not a campus that stands for free expression, this is a campus that stands for the silencing of all those who oppose their progressive doctrine. 
In their apology to Judge Duncan, Stanford says it is taking steps to ensure something like this does not happen again. 
%FNAME%, the truth is, there will be no accountability or change unless we DEMAND it.
Please add your name to Speech Firsts petition DEMANDING Stanford FIRE Tirien Steinbach for her despicable anti-free-speech actions.

Incidents like this remind me how grateful I am for free speech advocates like you. Together, we are furthering a movement  to protect free speech for all students on campus today and for generations to come.
Thank you for your support.

Speech First  April 2023  C5 (Texas State University Lawsuit)
Sender: Cherise Trump
Subject Line: Major Lawsuit Announcement

%FIRST%,
As Speech First continues to fight for free speech on college and university campuses, I wanted you to be one of the very first to hear about this new development...
We have filed a MASSIVE lawsuit against Texas State University in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas for its blatant and unacceptable violation of students First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.
Texas State and its Leftist administrators use school policies to DETER, SUPPRESS, and PUNISH constitutionally protected speech. Speech First is specifically going after their Discriminatory-Harassment Policy and their Computer Policy- both of which use overbroad restrictions on constitutionally protected speech about political and social issues of the day.
The school then goes after students for simply discussing politics and anything else deemed sensitive in emails, engaging with fellow classmates, and even commenting in class. 
These policies pose a grave threat of chilling the open and unfettered discourse that should be the central tenant of higher education. Instead of promoting an environment of learning, intellectual exploration, and open discourse, Texas State has chosen the opposite. By implementing policies that restrict how students can discuss politics or any of the societal issues of the day, the university has forced students to opt-out of classroom discussions.
Texas States Leftist administrators have created a campus controlled by fear where students are afraid to share their opinions, engage their classmates, or even posit new ideas. By violating their students First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, Texas State claims theyre protecting students.
How can Texas State claim to protect students while violating their rights?
Universities should be places where students can express themselves freely and engage in robust and thorough discussions without fear of retaliation. 
We will continue to fight for the rights of students to exercise their freedom of speech and expression without censorship or punishment.
%FIRST%, its only thanks to the support of free-speech advocates like you that Speech First can do this important legal work.
Thank you for standing with me and on the side of free speech!

- piece_1_pitch: Last Wednesday Speech First sued Indiana University (IU) for their Bias Response Team (BRT). And weve been making some headlines. The College Fix picked up our story and reported on our complaints agains IU and then listed 73 bias response reports they reviewed from IU. Some of them will shock you. In one instance they fired a professor for using a controversial racial slur that is used in Angie Thomas book The Hate U Give. Quoting a book now-a-days can get you in trouble in the current climate of college campuses. This is the exact reason were suing IU.

[[client_codex]]


The essence of a person's writing style is reflected in the consistent expression of their values through their personality. Unlike the goal, which is the desired end state, style is about how ideas are framed and conveyed. A writer's style can be identified through the characteristic word choice in repeated sentiment and recurring themes. 

Use 5 underscores to represent(and ignore) irrelevant content. Note that we want to ONLY imitate style. 
the "Woke" Left -> _____ 
faith into action -> _____ 

Example Style Abstraction Phrases: 
partnering in _____ mission 
_____ toxic agenda 
patriotic, _____ like you 
ect...

NEVER reference the personality profile. These are simply your clear and obvious beliefs

Dream a compelling character narrative that emphasizes each and EVERY one of the above character traits and values in as many words as necessary(length is not an issue). The CHALLENGE is to avoid EXPLICITLY describing personality traits. Reveal the character's personality through their life's actions and choices, EXCLUSIVELY through narrative. Write the character narrative in the above writing style, using dynamic sentence structure, direct, engaging, active voice, clear expression, facebook language, pleasing organization and structure, clarity, efficiency, and simplicity -> directly imaging the feel of the narrative. The character is a copywriter. Write in 2nd person perspective, starting with the words "You are now" and then a name

### line 1 framework
[[piece_1_structure_example_piece]]



Please create a topic-agnostic framework that outlines the flow and key elements of the above persuasive piece, focusing on how it purposefully guides the reader's attention. The framework should be generalized and adaptable to various topics. For each element, include the exact number of sentences used.

Use the following element format: 
Total word count: (entire piece word count (please underestimate by 20%))
[Element 1 description] (element 1 sentence count, element 1 word count)
[Element 2 description] (element 2 sentence count, element 2 word count)
ect...

Use vague language wherever possible:
law, order, and the police -> topic subject
a free book -> something valuable
$25 -> small contribution
Speech First -> organization

Example:
[Personalized greeting, emphasizing importance of topic subject] (x sen, y words)
[Initial call to action - gain some value in exchange for small contribution to support organization] (x2 sen, y2 words)
ect...

Avoid personal anecdotes and statistics as they don't abstract to new topics well (instead use your judgement and replace with something else)
Please create an element format, the purposeful elements of a persuasive piece, from introduction to conclusion. Go through each line, clearly tracing the attention and imaging the emotions of the reader. We're fundamentally abstracting out the order of techniques that intentionally direct the reader's perspective. ONLY write the element format. Don't discuss ANYTHING, just start with the first line
