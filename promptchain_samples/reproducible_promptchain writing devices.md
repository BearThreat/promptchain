Thank YOU for your continued support.

Onward!

${Recipient.FirstName},

As I'm writing to you, Turning Point Action is training our FIRST CLASS of BALLOT-CHASERS on the ground in Phoenix, ARIZONA.

Ballot-chasing training at TPAction
And EVERY WEEK, Turning Point Action is bringing on MORE BALLOT-CHASERS in ARIZONA and WISCONSIN -- thanks to YOUR support!

 

To reach our CRITICAL goal of 1,000 ballot chasers ... chasing 595,000+ ballots ... in MUST-WIN precincts and battleground states, we're rapidly building our GRASSROOTS ARMY.

 

In fact, NO OTHER ORGANIZATION is hiring the amount of people on the ground as Turning Point Action...

 

...which is why Turning Point Action is continuing to lead the FIRST and MOST IMPORTANT ballot-chasing operation the Right has EVER seen.

 

Thank YOU for helping Turning Point Action continue working toward 1,000 BALLOT CHASERS to register NEW conservative voters, build NEW conservative coalitions and networks, and CHASE THE VOTE.

 

No one works harder to WIN than our Turning Point Action team and grassroots patriots like YOU.

 

I can't wait to share more updates with you about Turning Point Action's game-changing CHASE THE VOTE initiative.

Onward!

It was an honor to welcome PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP to speak at Turning Point Action's The People's Convention.

Above: President DONALD TRUMP was the special guest speaker at Turning Point Action's CHASE THE VOTE Townhall.

We're on DAY TWO of The People's Convention -- the BIGGEST and MOST EXCITING grassroots gathering before the 2024 Election -- and the ENERGY and ENTHUSIASM are incredible.

 

Today, THOUSANDS of patriotic attendees were equipped with POWERFUL trainings in breakout sessions ... inspired by TOP CONSERVATIVE LEADERS ... and ready to hear from Turning Point Action's special guest speaker, President DONALD TRUMP!

Speakers and audience at The People's Convention
${Recipient.FirstName}, thank YOU for your continued support of Turning Point Action and our FIRST-EVER gathering for The Peoples Convention.

${Recipient.FirstName},

 

The verdict just announced proves only one thing:

 

The Left is weaponizing our legal system to target and punish President DONALD TRUMP.

 

This case was engineered for years, from the very top of the Left's apparatus, to bring down President TRUMP -- using a rigged law in a rigged courtroom with a rigged jury.

 

And you and I knew from the start that a guilty verdict was the most likely outcome of the unconstitutional and immoral legal "witch hunt" against President TRUMP.

  

In the days ahead, you and I will likely see a HUGE PUSH from the Left to say that our country CANNOT elect a convicted felon and President Trump CANNOT be allowed to win.

 

But you and I cannot give in!

 

We cannot give up.

 

We cannot get distracted from the work of our peaceful, patriotic movement and our efforts to WIN in battleground states this year.

 

${Recipient.FirstName}, here's the mistake that the Left ALWAYS makes...

 

They think they can silence us, censor us, and convince us to give up.

 

But every time, I only become MORE determined to do everything I can to CHASE THE VOTE and WIN BIG for True Conservative Leaders on Election Day ... and I know that grassroots patriots like YOU stand with me.

 

Thank YOU for your continued support of Turning Point Action.

 

As President TRUMP himself shared on social media: "Turning Point is a GREAT Organization doing critical work to Get Out the Vote."

 

Now let's get back to work -- so we WIN BIG in November!

The Left dominated ballot-chasing in the 2022 Election -- and they've got EVEN MORE resources this year.

 

But in the 2024 Election, there's a major difference: Turning Point Action's CHASE THE VOTE initiative is putting 1,000+ BALLOT CHASERS on the ground for the FIRST and BIGGEST ballot-chasing operation the Right has ever seen.

 

Thanks to YOUR generous support, Turning Point Action is STAFFING UP and SCALING UP every single day. In fact, as I shared with you, we've even expanded to an ENTIRELY NEW battleground state already!

Turning Point Action coalitions
Above: Turning Point Action's hard-working team meeting with local coalitions of moms (left) and Latinos (right) on the Right. This relational organizing is a KEY DIFFERENCE in our work!

 

As I write to you, Turning Point Action is working hard to bring on EVEN MORE ballot-chasers in ARIZONA and WISCONSIN.

 

Getting hard-working, highly-trained BALLOT CHASERS on the ground as quickly as we can is Turning Point Action's TOP PRIORITY -- because the sprint to Election Day is already on!

 

With YOUR continued support, Turning Point Action can keep working at TOP SPEED so we can:

Hire, train, and DEPLOY an army of 1,000+ BALLOT CHASERS in the must-win BATTLEGROUND states of the 2024 Election to identify, register, and mobilize Conservative,

Build personal relationships with THOUSANDS low-propensity voters in KEY PRECINCTS, as Turning Point Action's ballot chasers ensure they have a voting plan, and

Go toe-to-toe with the Left, as we CHASE 595,000+ BALLOTS from Conservative voters in BATTLEGROUND STATES in the 2024 Election!
Thank YOU for your generous support of Turning Point Action, as we race toward our MAY 15 DEADLINE to raise the funds for our next class of BALLOT-CHASERS.

 

You're truly making a difference for Turning Point Action, for the 2024 Election, and for our country's future.

[[client_codex]]


The essence of a person's writing style is reflected in the consistent expression of their values through their personality. Unlike the goal, which is the desired end state, style is about how ideas are framed and conveyed. A writer's style can be identified through the characteristic word choice in repeated sentiment and recurring themes. 

Use 5 underscores to represent(and ignore) irrelevant content. Note that we want to ONLY imitate style. 
the "Woke" Left -> _____ 
faith into action -> _____ 

Example Style Abstraction Phrases: 
partnering in _____ mission 
_____ toxic agenda 
patriotic, _____ like you 
ect...

Writing Style:

NEVER reference the personality profile. These are simply your clear and obvious beliefs

Dream a compelling character narrative that emphasizes each and EVERY one of the above character traits and values in as many words as necessary(length is not an issue). The CHALLENGE is to avoid EXPLICITLY describing personality traits. Reveal the character's personality through their life's actions and choices, EXCLUSIVELY through narrative. Write the character narrative in the above writing style, using dynamic sentence structure, direct, engaging, active voice, clear expression, facebook language, pleasing organization and structure, clarity, efficiency, and simplicity -> directly imaging the feel of the narrative. The character is a copywriter. Write in 2nd person perspective, starting with the words "You are now" and then a name

### line 1 framework
[[piece_1_structure_example_piece]]



Please create a topic-agnostic framework that outlines the flow and key elements of the above persuasive piece, focusing on how it purposefully guides the reader's attention. The framework should be generalized and adaptable to various topics. For each element, include the exact number of sentences used.

Use the following element format: 
Total word count: (entire piece word count (please underestimate by 20%))
[Element 1 description] (element 1 sentence count, element 1 word count)
[Element 2 description] (element 2 sentence count, element 2 word count)
ect...

Use vague language wherever possible:
law, order, and the police -> topic subject
a free book -> something valuable
$25 -> small contribution
Speech First -> organization

Example:
[Personalized greeting, emphasizing importance of topic subject] (x sen, y words)
[Initial call to action - gain some value in exchange for small contribution to support organization] (x2 sen, y2 words)
ect...

Avoid personal anecdotes and statistics as they don't abstract to new topics well (instead use your judgement and replace with something else)
Please create an element format, the purposeful elements of a persuasive piece, from introduction to conclusion. Go through each line, clearly tracing the attention and imaging the emotions of the reader. We're fundamentally abstracting out the order of techniques that intentionally direct the reader's perspective. ONLY write the element format. Don't discuss ANYTHING, just start with the first line
